# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis and rating prediction of movie reviews. Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the system analyzes reviews to classify them as positive or negative and predicts numerical ratings. The project also explores review similarity analysis using spaCy.

## Development Environment & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: 
  - `fasttext` for sentiment analysis
  - `LinearRegression` from `sklearn` for rating prediction
  - `spaCy` for text processing and similarity analysis
  - `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn` for feature extraction
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `nltk` for data processing and visualization
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
