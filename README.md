# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis and rating prediction of movie reviews. Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the system analyzes reviews to classify them as positive or negative and predicts numerical ratings. The project also explores review similarity analysis using spaCy.

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Set up a Python Environment**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook in your environment and open the `.ipynb` files to view the models and visualizations.

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute `python index.py` to start the sentiment analysis and rating prediction interface.

## Development Environment & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - `Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes` for sentiment analysis
  - `fasttext` for sentiment analysis
  - `LinearRegression` from `sklearn` for rating prediction
  - `spaCy` for text processing and similarity analysis
  - `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn` for feature extraction
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `nltk` for data processing and visualization
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
